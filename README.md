# Solar-grass-cutter
The “Solar Powered Grass Cutting Machine” is a robotic vehicle powered by solar 
energy that also avoids obstacles and is capable of automated grass cutting. The system uses 12V battery to power the 
vehicle movement motors as well as the grass cutter motor. A solar panel is used to charge the battery so that there is 
no need of charging it externally. The grass cutter and vehicle motors are interfaced to pick signal from microcontroller that controls 
the working of all the motors. It is also interfaced to an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection. The microcontroller 
moves the vehicle motors in forward direction in case no obstacle is detected. On obstacle detection the ultrasonic 
sensor monitors it and the microcontroller thus stops the grass cuter motor to avoid any damage. Microcontroller then turns the vehicle as long as it 
gets clear of the object and then moves the grass cutter in forward direction again otherwise it changes the direction.
